    <h4> The Marvel Super Heroes is an American animated television series starring five comic book superheroes from Marvel Comics.
    <h4> The first TV series based on Marvel characters, it debuted in syndication on U.S. television in 1966.
    The Avengers were a team of extraordinary individuals, with either superpowers or other special characteristics. Though primarily affiliated with the interests of the United States of America, the group's purpose was to protect global stability from inner or extraterrestrial threats. The Avengers were first assembled by S.H.I.E.L.D. as a result of the Avengers Initiative, when Loki invaded Earth with his Chitauri army. The team, consisting of Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Black Widow, Hawkeye and Hulk, defeated Loki and went their separate ways for a while.

After S.H.I.E.L.D. became a defunct agency due to the HYDRA infiltration, the team was no longer an American governmental division, therefore becoming an independent and private organization. Stark Industries remodeled Stark Tower into Avengers Tower and the team joined together in the fight against HYDRA. After their victory, Stark built Ultron, hoping that the A.I. would be able to defend the world from any threats necessary in place of the Avengers. The plan backfired and Ultron started a war against humanity, forcing the Avengers to fight him. When Ultron was defeated, Hulk, Barton, Thor and Stark left the team, so Scarlet Witch, Vision, War Machine and Falcon were recruited, and they were relocated to the Avengers Compound.

Under Captain America's leadership, the team completed several operations around the world with success, until the amount of collateral damage during their conflicts caused the United Nations to pass the Sokovia Accords in an attempt to regulate their actions, turning the team from a private organization to one which was under the control of the government. The differences in opinions created a rift within the team which split the Avengers into two factions, one led by Iron Man and the other by Captain America. After Captain America was able to stop Helmut Zemo, the instigator of their fight, the team was divided; Iron Man, Vision and War Machine remained official members, while a small group consisting of Captain America, Black Widow, and Falcon continued to operate in the shadows. Stark would try to boost the Avengers' membership by inviting Spider-Man to join, but the young hero turned down the offer to remain closer to the people he had sworn to protect.

Two years after the Accords were ratified, Thanos launched a crusade against the universe in his quest to gather the Infinity Stones. The Avengers were split up into different groups as they fought to combat Thanos before he succeeded, joining forces with the Masters of the Mystic Arts, the Wakandans, and the Guardians of the Galaxy. Iron Man and Spider-Man went to Titan alongside Doctor Strange, where they allied with Star-Lord, Nebula, Mantis and Drax to try to stop Thanos, while Captain America, Banner, Black Widow, War Machine, Falcon, Thor, Groot, Rocket Raccoon and Scarlet Witch protected Vision from the Black Order in Wakanda. The team on Wakanda was successful in killing Thanos' minions, but the team on Titan was defeated. Thanos arrived and overpowered the heroes on Wakanda with ease before killing Vision to acquire the Mind Stone, thus completing the Infinity Gauntlet, and eradicating half of the universe's population. Among the victims were Falcon, Scarlet Witch, and Spider-Man; with only Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Banner, Black Widow, and War Machine surviving the war. Despite them managing to kill Thanos, the victory was empty, as the Infinity Stones were destroyed, ensuring no chances of undoing the Snap. This failure greatly impacted each of the Avengers, leaving Black Widow, War Machine, Rocket, Nebula, Captain Marvel, and Okoye as the remaining members, trying to maintain order on Earth and the wider universe.  <br>

<h1> Iron Man</h1> <img src="ironman11.png" alt="" width="100px">

<h4>
    ron Man, many people know about him, some people have never heard of him, he is a hero. there are a couple of reasons people would consider a villain, but there are many reasons people would consider him a hero. Since he is my hero i will tell you the reasons why i think that he is a hero. First, he created weapons for our army, and they were superb weapons not just any weapon he created the best. Next, he made the Iron Man suit which is like the greatest weapon of all time, and he created like four of the suits and they were all usable. That is why i think of Iron Man as my hero.

Iron Man is a hero for many reasons, like i talked about in my last paragraph, those were just the little reasons. Now it's time for the major reasons why he is a hero. One would be because he saves many people by creating the guns that he creates for the U.S. Army. Then there is where he ends the manufacturing of Iron Man suits because they are causing nothing but trouble and he is left with just one for himself so that he can help our country, but at the same time all the chaos from all the Iron Man suits being made is ended. Then his actions he makes are all heroic; he makes good decisions on what to do when he is making his weapons and making the suits. In the imaginary real world he does good actions that are heroic.

Starting off with telling you my definition of a hero and the dictionary definitions of a hero, i think that you know now that Iron Man is a true hero. You basically know the legend of Iron Man now, i told you all that i could about him. He is just like every other hero, he has his pros and cons, but in the end he is someone's hero, not only mine but many more people's. Well to end it all off, thank you for taking your time to learn about my hero Iron Man.

<h1>Captain America</h1><img src="cap america.png" alt="" width="100px">

<h4>
    Captain America belongs to the Marvel Universe. He is the greatest hero I know because he is different from the rest of the Avengers, as Captain America is the first to shield others from threat, even a danger greater than that he can manage alone. If it means helping another person, he's more than ready to risk his own life. Some consider the most selfless Avenger to still be Captain.

<br>
He goes by the name Steve Rogers or the greatest soldier in history and if you still don’t know who he is then maybe you’ll know him by his original name “Super America”. Okay never mind, probably not because the creators realised that it didn’t sound good as too many Marvel Superheroes had the word “Super” in them and so they finally agreed on “Captain America” which clearly sounds much better than Super America. 



Captain America is a fictional Marvel Superhero which was created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby in 1941. He was known as Steve Rogers at first, but because of his bravery and compassion, a scientist created the Super Solider Serum which enhanced Steve Rogers’ human potentials and thus gave birth to Captain America. The characterisation of Captain America was influenced by political social injustice during the 20th century. Captain America, obviously being American who is part of the Allied Powers, fought against the Axis Powers which consisted of Germany, Italy and Japan. Captain America is seen as a heroic icon in WW2 as well as in the battles against Communism. The Superhero, Captain America, was thus used…show more content…
The colour scheme has remained the same. However the design of costume has clearly evolved from the original one. Here, he wears a helmet with the letter “A” and wings printed on it instead of a mask.  The stripes have also changed. There are stripes on two sides of his shoulders going vertically down up to his waist. White stars have also been added to his gloves.

<h1>Hulk</h1><img src="hulk11.png" alt="" width="170px">
 

<h4>
    The Incredible Hulk is a fiction movie released on June 8, 2008. The movie was produced by Marvel Studios and Valhalla Motion Pictures. The film took place mostly in Toronto, Canada. The director of the movie is Louis Leterrier. The movie is about a person named Bruce Banner who transforms into a beast called the Hulk, a huge green monster with a muscular body. The transformation is caused by a disease that contaminated Banner’s cells. The transformation happens whenever Banner gets angry. However, the anger goes away when the Hulk sees that there is no danger around him. The anger goes away whenever his love, Betty Ross touches him. Banner searches the world to find a cure for his disease, but the military keeps blocking his way because they want his power to create an army just like the Hulk. New threats appear trying to use the masculinity in order to achieve whatever needed. In addition, the Hulk faces his nemesis called The Abomination. It is also a green monster that literally has similar powers as the Hulk. The Hulk character embodies a larger tension with our culture’s relation to masculinity. On one hand, it condemns the destruction and violence associated with masculinity, and on the other, it celebrates it. The film can be viewed as having mixed messages for boys because it provides unrealistic masculinity that represents good and bad manners.

The film represents violence of destruction as associated with masculinity, and it shows this as a negative attitude, and

<h1> Thor </h1> <img src="thor11.png" alt="" width="120px">
 
<h4>
    A superhero is a person who possesses immense herculean strength and sorcerous abilities.  Many superheroes can accomplish this, but there is one that can do this more exceptional than any other! This superhero is extremely important in Norse mythology as he is the God of Thunder. He was gifted with an enchanted hammer which can only be lifted by someone who is worthy enough. The hammer can control elements of storms like lightning, wind and thunder to help him vanquish his enemies. Did you ever question yourself who this amazing superhero could be? This splendid superhero’s name is Thor! Thor is the most supreme superhero of all time because he has super strength, his perceiving personality and his enchanted hammer called Mjolnir. Thor’s super powers play a major role when fighting villains to serve justice. Thor did not recognize his unbelievable superpowers right away, in fact, he did not realize that he was even Thor until later on in his life. He was first a psychiatric nurse called Thorlief Golmen. One day he suffered a nervous breakdown before his 30th birthday. During the 18 months he spent institutionalized, he claims to have realized who he was and why he has been sent to Earth. This is when he realized he was Thor, the Norse God of Thunder, to save the planet. After getting in many fights he figured out his most useful power was his magnificent strength. He is so remarkably strong that his strength level is officially rated at Class 100 in the

    The Avengers, excellent movie of all times for sure, no opposition. Great story line, great screenplay, and best of all, great characters. The characters’ personalities are amazing together, and even more amazing when studied individually. What makes them so amazing are their very contrasting characteristics. My primary focus, The Incredible Hulk, and The Black Widow, two opposing forces, so similar yet so different. A great powerful beast and a beautiful young woman, but do not let body sizes fool you.

    First and foremost, The Black Widow possesses no superpowers unlike the Hulk, who transforms into a gigantic green beast when enraged. She does not have to rely on any super powers in combat, but only relies on her strength, stealth, and knowledge of weaponry. On the…show more content…
    His anger is so easily triggered even by the smallest of things. In the movie, we find that he has to be cooled down, even by the use of lullabies which is pretty bizarre to use on the whole has grown up. Without being calmed down, he is accomplished by destroying everything in his way. The Black Widow seemingly was the only one that was able to take it easy this beast meritoriously. She sang to him to calm him down. To effectively calm anyone down, one needs to be gentle and gracious themselves. The Black Widow was both soft and kind enough to be able to handle Hulk, even after he had transformed into a beast, which was very courageous of her as The Hulk could easily tear her to pieces without thinking twice. It is no wonder that she and Hulk fell in love with each other. Opposite poles attract anyways. In the movie, we see that she is usually calm and collected even when enraged. She does not act on anger but instead remains quiet and strategies her moves to revenge. Even when Hulk refuses to keep cool at times, she remains patient and keeps trying to calm him down till she succeeds without getting angry

<h1>Doctor Strange</h1><img src="strange11.png" alt="" width="140px">

<h4>
    Of all the superhero films released this year, Marvel's Doctor Strange is without a doubt the one that I was most excited to see - yes, ahead of Captain America: Civil War and Batman V Superman. It is no secret that I'm not a Marvel Comics reader but I do enjoy their animated adaptations. Doctor Strange has appeared as the sorcerer supreme over many of Marvel's animated series such as Ultimate Spider-Man, Avengers Assemble and he even had his own film! Over my lifetime as a comic book enthusiast, no hero has ever managed to knock Doctor Strange off the title of 'Hero I Aspire to Be' - Doctor Fate came really close with his New 52 remake in Earth 2 - primarily due to his mystical abilities and his personal struggles. When the Orb of Agamotto…show more content…
    I have to say that the CGI of his accident was so brilliantly done that it borders on cringe-worthy, leaving me grabbing my hands in shock. This is only one of the many moments of this magically film that really immerses you into the life of doctor Stephen Strange. While some have been quick to point out that it would have been longer to really build up to the event (accident), I stand by that it was the perfect amount of development given that we already know how this part of the story plays out. What we want from this film isn't about his time being a surgeon but rather his time exploring the mystical…show more content…
    Marvel's Doctor Strange manages to surpass all its predecessors in this aspect. While it was primarily Cumberbatch's intoxicating personality and Wong's unlikely humorous side manages to balance the film's dark and potentially cataclysmic story, it was undoubtedly Rachel McAdams that deserves the recognition for lightening up the movie. Her subtle beauty coupled with her effective portrayal of her character's innocence radiates in every scene she's in - especially when finding out about magic and all that mystical stuff. If anyone was to win an award for this film, McAdams is definitely the only one I'd vote

    <h4>
        There are all types of heroes all over the world. A hero is defined by the choices they make and the things they achieve. Spiderman is a hero like no other. He wasn't always Spider-man, he used to be a young teen named Peter Parker. Peter lived a difficult childhood because he was an orphan who was very timid and shy. He was also very smart but he often got bullied. He lived with his aunt and uncle in New York City. You could also describe him as a geeky science nerd who consistently seeked attention from Mary Jane, who he crushed on since they were six years old. He lived an ordinary life and only really had two real friends who were Harry and Mary Jane. Who would think that Peter Parker would undergo such a miraculous transformation and become the supero that he is. He was blessed with the superpowers but yet cursed at the same time. It brought moments that caused him hardships in his life and he had to cope with them. Without a doubt Spider-man, is a true hero that undergoes an epic journey. 



        In Spider-man, the patterns are very similar to those of the hero's journey of motif. The call for adventure in Spider-man starts when he goes on a field trip with his high school. They visited a genetics laboratory. While he was taking photos in the laboratory, he was bitten on the hand by a genetically engineered super spider. At first he didn't think anything had happened because he didn't notice any sort of reaction but when he arrived home he passed out. His hand was

<h4>
    The race for the role of Captain Marvel is certainly heating up now that MMA fighter Ronda Rousey has decided to enter the picture, with her strong fanbase already doing artworks of her in the superhero costume.

Rousey shared the artworks on her Instagram account and wrote, "Since the reddit AMA I've received so many badass Ms. Marvel/Captain Marvel edits! There were so many cool ones I couldn't pick just one to share."

Her millions of Instagram followers seem to think that Rousey would be perfect for the role, and are already vying for her to get it. One of Rousey's fans, screenwriter and actor slash producer Kevin Smith could not agree more, and when approached by TMZ at the airport regarding Rousey's possible portrayal of Captain Marvel, he said that Marvel execs need not scramble…show more content…
C'mon. You don't even need to think at this point. There's an image. We can see it. She looks amazing. Lord knows she's one of the only people who would play a superhero that would actually beat the shit out of somebody. I would like to see it happen," he said.

Earlier, there were reports that Marvel is eyeing actress turned director Angelina Jolie to helm the "Captain Marvel" film, but should she be chosen for the job, her choice of actress would be part and parcel of the deal.

"Marvel has been courting Angie to direct the project and Charlize (Theron) is a clear fan favorite for the starring role. If Charlize were to get the part, Angie would almost certainly sign on to work with her new pal," a source told OK! Magazine.

But there are lots of other actresses who are being pushed by fans to play Carol Danvers and Captain Marvel - Jessica Chastain, Emily Blunt, and Katheryn Winnick.

Winnick, who plays tough "Vikings" wife Lagertha Lothbrok is very keen on playing Danvers, who is considered as Marvel's first female superhero, and has the ability to fly and absorb and project energy. She also has superhuman strength, speed, stamina, and

<h1>Black Panther</h1> <img src="black panther1.png" alt="" width="120px">


<h4>
    Black Panther is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist-coplotter Jack Kirby. The character first appeared in Fantastic Four #52 (cover-dated July 1966) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. Black Panther's real name is T'Challa, and he is depicted as the king and protector of the fictional African nation of Wakanda. Along with possessing enhanced abilities achieved through ancient Wakandan rituals of drinking the essence of the heart-shaped herb, T'Challa also relies on his proficiency in science, rigorous physical training, hand-to-hand combat skills, and access to wealth and advanced Wakandan technology to combat his enemies.

    Black Panther is the first superhero of African descent in mainstream American comics, having debuted years before early black superheroes such as Marvel Comics' the Falcon (1969), Luke Cage (1972), and Blade (1973) or DC Comics' John Stewart in the role of Green Lantern (1971). In one comic book storyline, the Black Panther mantle is handled by Kasper Cole, a multiracial New York City police officer. Beginning as an impersonator, Cole would later take on the moniker of White Tiger and become an ally to T'Challa. The role of Black Panther and leadership of Wakanda was also given to T'Challa's sister Shuri while he was in a coma for a short time.
    
    Black Panther has made numerous appearances in various television shows, animated films and video games. Chadwick Boseman portrayed the character in Phase Three of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's films: Captain America: Civil War (2016), Black Panther (2018), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Avengers: Endgame (2019), and voiced alternate versions of the character in the first season of the animated series What If...? (2021).

<h1> The Guardians Of The Galaxy</h1><img src="gurdiens11.png" alt="" width="200px">
 

<h4>
    I initially chosen the movie Guardians of the Galaxy so I can elaborate on what is my favorite superhero film of all time. Being highly rated among other superhero movies, as well as containing an indie vibe, it happens to contain many aspects of film that creates a marvelous movie. Guardians of the Galaxy is an innovative movie in the superhero genre, because it has quirky story, but it somehow brings crazy comedy, middle-aged music, and of course the action-packed fun. I believe this film was a revolutionary idea in the genre and industry. From special effects to music, Guardians of the Galaxy packs a punch with the elements and techniques of a great production, which is why I chose to write about it. I was very confident in choosing Guardians of the Galaxy due to the film aspects of sound, special effects, and the narrative. Guardians of the Galaxy is a sci-fi superhero movie with explosions, romance, and comedy. The story begins with Starlord (Chris Pratt) traveling to ruins to steal items. Starlord meets with a group of criminals, Rocket, Groot, Drax and Gomara, which their main goal is to work together to stop an alien warrior from taking control of the universe with the mysterious orb. They work together to recover the orb, and transport it to The Collector, who reveals that it houses an Infinity Gem-  one rare gem that holds a high percentage of power in the universe. To protect Xandar, they fight of Ronan and his group of alien thugs. Ronan wants to commit massive

    Wanda Maximoff is a native of Sokovia who grew up with her fraternal twin brother, Pietro. Born with the latent mythical ability to harness Chaos Magic, she developed a hatred against Tony Stark and rallied anti-American protests after the Novi Grad Bombings killed her parents. Years later, in an effort to help purge their country of strife, the twins joined HYDRA and agreed to undergo experiments with the Scepter under the supervision of Baron Strucker, with the Mind Stone awakening and amplifying Wanda's powers. While her brother developed super-speed, she attained various psionic abilities. When HYDRA fell, the twins joined Ultron to get their revenge on Stark, but abandoned him when they discovered his true intentions to eradicate humanity. Wanda and Pietro joined the Avengers during the Battle of Sokovia to stop Ultron; Pietro was killed during the battle but Wanda survived, and shortly after relocated to the Avengers Compound in the United States of America.

During the Avengers Civil War, she sided with Captain America and was briefly imprisoned in the Raft before Rogers freed her alongside his teammates. Over the next two years, Maximoff reunited and reconciled with Vision, and together the two started living off the grid in Europe, forming a romantic relationship. In 2018, they were ambushed by the Black Order, who sought the Mind Stone, and rejoined the Avengers to seek refuge in Wakanda. Maximoff took part in the city's defence when the Black Order invaded the city, where she was forced to kill Vision to prevent Thanos from completing the Infinity Gauntlet. However, she witnessed Thanos resurrect and kill Vision before initiating the Snap, which claimed Maximoff's life. After the victims of the Snap were resurrected in 2023, Maximoff was among the many heroes who fought during the Battle of Earth, defeating Thanos and his armies.

    <h4>
        Scott Edward Harris Lang is a former convicted thief who was struggling to pay child support to his estranged wife for visitation rights to his daughter, Cassie Lang. With the promise of money, he was convinced by Hank Pym to take on the mantle of Ant-Man: a superhero with an advanced suit designed to shrink its wearer to a tiny size while increasing one's toughness, agility, and physical strength. Trained under both Pym and his daughter Hope van Dyne, Ant-Man was to help foil Pym's former protege Darren Cross, who was intending to sell his Yellowjacket Suit design and his copy of the Pym Particles formula to HYDRA and the Ten Rings. However, their plan was discovered by Cross, culminating in a final fight between Yellowjacket and Ant-Man. To defeat Yellowjacket, Ant-Man had to shrink small enough to enter Yellowjacket's suit and destroy it, sending Ant-Man to the Quantum Realm, but Ant-Man was able to escape. Ant-Man's heroism helped restore his relationship with Cassie and his ex-wife, as well as find a new romantic one with van Dyne. Lang soon learned that the Avengers were seeking to recruit him.

Against Pym and van Dyne's wishes, Ant-Man joined Captain America's side during the Avengers Civil War, having been recommended by the Falcon following their previous encounter at the Avengers Compound, and being informed of Helmut Zemo's plan to awaken the Winter Soldiers. Ant-Man fought against Iron Man and his allies, demonstrating his suit's new ability to enlarge his body to a gigantic size, and allowing Captain America and Winter Soldier to escape and find Zemo. Ant-Man and several of his new allies were then arrested by Thaddeus Ross, who had them imprisoned in the Raft for breaking the Sokovia Accords. When Captain America arrived to free them, Ant-Man escaped, but later made a deal with the FBI to be put under house arrest so that he could still spend time with his family.

<h1> Loki</h1> <img src="loki11.png" alt="" width="150px">


<h4>
    Loki Laufeyson was the biological son of Laufey, the ruler of the Frost Giants in Jotunheim, who was abandoned and left to die shortly after his birth. Found by Odin, Loki was taken to Asgard and raised by him and Frigga as an Asgardian prince, along with Thor. When Thor was to be crowned King, Loki had sabotaged the coronation by letting the Frost Giants attack Asgard, thus leading Thor to seek vengeance on Jotunheim, which resulted in Thor's banishment to Earth and Loki finding out the truth about his heritage. Frigga gave Loki the throne when Odin had fallen into the Odinsleep; however, when the Warriors Three and Sif attempted to return Thor home, Loki was forced to try to stop them. Regardless, Thor returned from his exile on Earth and ended Loki's reign, thwarting his attempt to declare war on the Nine Realms with Jotunheim's destruction. With Odin disapproving of his actions, Loki allowed himself to fall through the deep abyss of space, entering a wormhole created by the sudden termination of the Bifrost Bridge.

Transported by the wormhole to Sanctuary, Loki encountered The Other who offered to serve under Thanos' command and gave him the Scepter. Loki was given command over the Chitauri army in order to conquer Earth, under the provision that Loki acquires the Tesseract for Thanos. Once he came to Earth, Loki managed to take possession of the Tesseract and used its power to open a wormhole above New York City and caused the Chitauri Invasion, but all of Loki's schemes were ultimately defeated by the Avengers. Thor returned him to Asgard as his prisoner, where Odin condemned him to spend the rest of his life in the Asgardian Dungeons as punishment for his crimes.


of Asgard, chose to stay by his brother's side and support his ascension onto the throne. Consequences of his deal with Thanos would soon come back to haunt Loki, however, as the Mad Titan and his Black Order intercepted the Asgardians as they were making their way towards Earth. In the chaos that followed, Loki attempted to kill Thanos but ultimately failed. When Loki taunted Thanos by telling him that he would never be a god, the Mad Titan snapped his neck, finally killing the God of Mischief.

<h1>Hela</h1> <img src="hela11.png" alt="" width="150px">
 

<h4>
    Hela Odinsdottir was the Asgardian goddess of death and former Executioner of Asgard. Imprisoned in Hel for millennia by her father Odin, Hela was only released from her prison in the wake of his death and went to restore her power over Asgard while simultaneously engaging in a series of encounters with her younger brothers Thor and Loki. Gaining her power from Asgard, Hela planned to rule Asgard and create an Asgardian Empire. When all the people of Asgard refused to bow to her, Hela set about massacring Odin's armies and enslaving their people, while recruiting Skurge to be her own Executioner in the process. Eventually, however, Thor then returned with the newly formed Revengers and then reengaged Hela, which had then resulted with Loki unleashing Surtur, who then destroyed Asgard by finally causing Ragnarök and killed Hela as a result.

<h1> Thanos </h1> <img src="Thanos11.png" alt="" width="130px">


<h4>
    Thanos was a genocidal warlord from Titan, whose objective was to bring stability to the universe by wiping out half of all life at every level, as he believed its massive population would inevitably use up the universe's entire supply of resources and perish. To complete this goal, Thanos set about hunting down all the Infinity Stones, being confident that the combined force of the Stones would grant him sufficient power. Thanos forged alliances with Loki and Ronan the Accuser in order to track down some of the Stones. However, both alliances cost Thanos much of his resources, including the Mind Stone and the loyalty of his daughters, Gamora and Nebula. Fed up with all his subordinates' ongoing failures, Thanos made the decision to seek and procure the Stones himself, and he began by forcing Eitri to create the Infinity Gauntlet for him so that he would be able to wield the power of the Stones safely.

    Thanos then engaged in a ferocious crusade in order to obtain the Infinity Stones. During his mission, both Thanos and his Black Order invaded multiple planets and slaughtered thousands to gain the stones, including Loki and the Asgardians. This quest even forced Thanos to sacrifice his beloved Gamora, in order to take the Soul Stone. Thanos soon found himself challenged by the alliances of the entire universe's greatest heroes, which included the Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy. However, despite facing off against the powerfully combined opposition and the wrath of Thor, Thanos still ultimately triumphed as he completed the Infinity Gauntlet, using it to finally complete his goal through the Snap, which resulted in half of all life in the universe being wiped out with a mere snap of his fingers. Following his Snap, Thanos had then ensured this could never be undone by destroying all of the Infinity Stones, resulting in the Avengers tracking him down on Planet 0259-S, where Thor executed him with Stormbreaker.
